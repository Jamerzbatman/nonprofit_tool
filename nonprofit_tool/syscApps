Yes, you can set up a system to automatically update all websites from a central database on your site. Here’s how you can approach this:

1. Centralized Management System
Central Database:

Store Data: Use your central database to manage and store all app data, configurations, and versions.
Track Changes: Implement a system to track changes and updates to apps, including versioning and metadata.
Update Mechanism:

Version Control: Ensure that changes are versioned in your central database so that each site can retrieve and apply the latest updates.
2. Automated Update System
Update Scheduling:

Cron Jobs or Scheduled Tasks: Set up scheduled tasks (e.g., using cron jobs) on your server to periodically check for updates and push them to all sites.
Task Scheduling Tools: Use tools like Celery for task scheduling and background processing if you need more advanced scheduling and control.
Update Propagation:

Notification System: Implement a notification system that alerts each site when an update is available.
Automatic Pull: Develop scripts or services that automatically pull updates from your central database and apply them to each site.
3. Implementation Steps
Define Update Process:

Determine Scope: Define what changes need to be updated (e.g., code updates, configuration changes, database schema changes).
Update Logic: Develop logic to apply updates to each site, including handling dependencies and resolving conflicts.
Create Update Scripts:

Fetch Changes: Write scripts to fetch changes from the central database.
Apply Updates: Develop scripts to apply these changes to each site’s database, file system, and configurations.
Deploy Updates:

Push Updates: Use deployment automation tools or custom scripts to push updates to each site.
Database Migrations: Include scripts for applying database migrations if needed.
Monitor and Log:

Logging: Implement logging to track the update process and capture any errors or issues.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring to ensure updates are applied correctly and sites are functioning as expected.
Example Workflow:
Central Database Update:

You make changes or updates to an app in your central database.
Scheduled Task Execution:

A scheduled task or cron job triggers at a predefined interval to check for new updates.
Notification and Pull:

Sites are notified of the available update. Each site pulls the latest changes from the central database.
Apply Updates:

The update scripts are executed to apply the changes to each site’s environment.
Verification:

Ensure that the updates are applied correctly by performing automated tests or manual checks.
Technologies and Tools
Cron Jobs: For simple scheduling tasks on Unix-like systems.
Celery: For more advanced task scheduling and background processing.
Fabric or Ansible: For deployment automation and managing updates across multiple sites.
Custom Scripts: For fetching and applying updates based on your specific requirements.
Summary
To keep everything on your site updated automatically, you can use a centralized management system combined with automated update processes. By scheduling regular updates, implementing scripts to fetch and apply changes, and setting up a robust notification and logging system, you can ensure that all sites are kept up to date with the latest changes from your central database.
