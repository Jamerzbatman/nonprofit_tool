4. Displaying and Editing Functions
View/Edit Function: When a function name is clicked, display a detailed view of the function, showing its code, metadata, and usage instructions.
Edit Mode: Provide an "Edit" button that turns the display into a form, allowing users to modify the function code or metadata. Save changes back to the database.
5. Executing and Testing Functions
Testing Interface: Include a feature within the detailed view to test the function with sample inputs. This would allow users to run the function in a controlled environment and see the output.
Logging and Debugging: Store logs or errors generated during execution to help with debugging. This can be viewed in the same detailed view or in a separate log viewer.
6. Managing Function Relationships
Linking to Models/Views: If the function is related to specific models or views, include this information in the metadata and display it in the detailed view. Clicking these links could take the user directly to those models or views for further editing.
Modular Organization: Allow grouping functions into modules (e.g., User Management, Data Processing). This helps in organizing and managing functions more effectively.
7. Version Control and Backups
Version History: Implement version control for functions, allowing users to revert to previous versions if necessary. Store the version history in the database.
Backup System: Periodically back up the function data, so no changes are permanently lost.
8. User Access and Permissions
Permissions Management: Control who can view, edit, or delete functions based on user roles within the Django admin.
Audit Logs: Maintain audit logs of changes made to functions, including who made the changes and when.
9. Deploy and Integrate
Deployment: Ensure that the functions can be deployed with the rest of the appâ€™s codebase, either by writing them to physical files or dynamically loading them from the database during runtime.
Integration: If these functions need to interact with existing parts of your application (e.g., views, models), ensure they are correctly referenced and executed where needed.
10. User Experience Enhancements
Search and Filter: Add search and filter options in the function listing page to quickly find specific functions based on names, descriptions, or modules.
Tooltips and Help: Provide tooltips or inline help text to guide users through the process of adding, editing, and managing functions.
This step-by-step approach provides a comprehensive way to create a dynamic, flexible, and user-friendly function management system within your Django app.
