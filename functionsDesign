Functions

- when adding a function the url isn't getting saved right

- add open ai chat to edit function modal

- Executing and Testing Functions
Testing Interface: Include a feature within the detailed view to test the function with sample inputs. This would allow users to run the function in a controlled environment and see the output.
Logging and Debugging: Store logs or errors generated during execution to help with debugging. This can be viewed in the same detailed view or in a separate log viewer.

- Managing Function Relationships
Linking to Models/Views: If the function is related to specific models or views, include this information in the metadata and display it in the detailed view. Clicking these links could take the user directly to those models or views for further editing.
Modular Organization: Allow grouping functions into modules (e.g., User Management, Data Processing). This helps in organizing and managing functions more effectively.
