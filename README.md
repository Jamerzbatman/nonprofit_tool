1. App Creation Interface
Admin View: Create a custom admin view where you can input the details for a new app (e.g., app name, description, initial settings).
Form: This view would include a form that captures all necessary information to generate a new app using your predefined template.
2. Custom Management Commands
Command Integration: Link the app creation form in your admin dashboard to a custom Django management command. This command would generate a new app based on your template and register it within the project.
Trigger: When you submit the form, the management command would be triggered to create the new app, handle initial migrations, and integrate it with the main project.
3. App Management
App List: Add a section in your dashboard that lists all existing apps, allowing you to manage them (e.g., enable/disable, update settings, or uninstall).
App Configuration: Provide options to configure each app from within the dashboard, such as updating settings, managing permissions, or connecting APIs.
4. Dynamic App Integration
Auto-Registration: Ensure that newly created apps are automatically registered with the main dashboard. This can be done using Django’s AppConfig or by dynamically updating the INSTALLED_APPS setting from within your admin interface.
URL Management: Set up your system to automatically include the URLs of new apps, ensuring they’re accessible from the main dashboard.
5. Testing and Deployment
Automated Testing: Include an option in your admin dashboard to run tests on new apps before they go live. This can be integrated with your CI/CD pipeline.
Deployment Controls: Add deployment controls that allow you to push new apps live directly from the admin dashboard once they’re ready.
6. Templates and Plugins
Template Management: Include a section to manage and update the base app template itself. This allows you to tweak the template as your needs evolve, ensuring all future apps benefit from improvements.
Pluggable Features: Allow the admin to choose additional plugins or features that should be included in the new app, making it easier to customize each app’s functionality.
7. Monitoring and Logging
Activity Log: Implement an activity log within the admin dashboard that tracks when new apps are created, modified, or deleted. This will help with managing the overall health and performance of your suite.
Monitoring Tools: Integrate monitoring tools that keep an eye on the performance of each app, giving you insights directly from the admin dashboard.
By integrating these features into your super admin dashboard, you can centralize all aspects of app creation, management, and deployment, making it easier to handle everything from a single interface. This will streamline your workflow, especially since you’re primarily developing solo.
